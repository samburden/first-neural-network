# Deep Learning - First Neural Network project

This is a simple neural network used for predicting daily bike rental demand for a bike rental company. The data used for this project can be found in the [Bike-Sharing-Dataset](Bike-Sharing-Dataset) folder.

This project is using Python 3 and needs the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook

These can be installed using pip or conda if using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and can be run using the following from a terminal:

```jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb```
